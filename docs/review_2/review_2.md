# Review of Delta's Second Partial Assignment

## System Design

##### System components

Multiple times throughout the report emails are being sent, how is this supposed to happen? Has a mail server been setup or is a mail service used?

You mention you use SQL for your database (Remember it isn't a database but a special-purpose programming language), but a specific choice of database has not been documented.

##### Test

No user test has been documented (or conducted?).

Prototype presentation has not been documented (or conducted?).

Don't expect you are done with system design, until you have presented a prototype to the client.

## Assignment specific

Change log missing? Since nothing was written should I just assume it missing?

Group Dynamics seems to be missing?

Minutes from meetings with clients missing?

Bibliography missing?

Quite a lot of mistakes in the written text, inconsistencies, missing parts, etc. Check PDF with comments.
