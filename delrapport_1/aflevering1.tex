\subsection{Problem statement}
\subsubsection{Problem Domain}
At the University, many courses require the students to hand in assignments. In this modern era, this is done by electronic hand-ins over the World Web Web on the interconnected global network. It is essential to ensure that there can be no doubt of the identity of the student handing in the assignment because the teachers grade the students based on these electronic hand-ins. \\\\

This problem can be solved by a classic login system, where the user has a unique username and picks a password as a secret piece of information to avoid malicious parties to get access to user privileges. This system has already been implemented by the Norwegian company its Learning through the World Wide Web platform ``Absalon''.\\\\

Another option, which is the subject of this project, is to use asymmetric key encryption. In this system the user, i.e. the student, generates a key pair on his own computer. This keypair can be used for authentication and can also be used in other situations. The authenticity of the key pair can be further validated by peer-to-peer authentication through the signing of other peoples' keys.\\\\

The students at the University of Copenhagen all have a unique username in the form of a ``KU Username''. If this username is mapped to a public key and the student holds the equivalent private key, then the authentication of an electronic hand-in has the same degree of trusted authenticity as that of the key pair. \\\\

We can use the KU login in order to establish this mapping and this mapping can be further authenticated by the above-mentioned peer-to-peer key signing although this is not necessary for the system to work. But as a way to establish this mapping, the KU login pair (KU Username and KU password) is used as a trusted source of linking an identity to a public key. The role, if any, of peer-to-peer signing or key signing by teachers has not yet been established.

\item A student has just started on the course ``Maskinarkitektur'' (Processor Design). He learns that he has to hand in the assignment by signing it with an OpenPGP key. He must then generate his own

The role, if any, of peer-to-peer signing or key signing by teachers has not yet been established.
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
\item A student has just started on the course ``Maskinarkitektur'' (Processor Design). He learns that he has to hand in the assignment by signing it with an OpenPGP key. He must then generate his own key pair using a designated program like ``GPG4Win'' or through a webservice developed as a part of this project and hosted by KU. After the key pair has been generated, the student uploads his public key to a server and the server then stores the KU Username and the public key. 
\item When the student hands in his assignment, he signs it with his newly generated private key. And the signature is then uploaded along with the assignment. A teacher is grading the assignments that has been handed in on the course ``Maskinarkitektur''. Before he grades them, he needs to check the validity of the identity of the student. This check can either be done automatically by software that interfaces with the system developed as part of this project or manually by the teacher.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system must map a KU Username to a PGP public key.
\item Users must be able to upload keys to a table in a database.
\item The upload and initial authentication happens through the KU email system.
\item Lookups in this must be possible for university staff involved in teaching.
\item If a user loses his private key, a method for replacing the public key must exits.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Nunfunctional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The backend should be written in golang.
\item The frontend should be Javascript and/or HTML5 (that which is safest and most easy to use -- not yet fully determined).
\item The system should be browser independent. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Target Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The frontend must work on the newest editions of all mainstream browsers (IE, FF, Chrome, Safari).
\item The backend software must be able to run on any Unix-based system.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Delivarables and Deadlines}
\begin{itemize}
\item The whole project must be done by June 3$^{rd}$, 2015.
